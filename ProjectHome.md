<strike>A RelaxNG parser for java. this is based heavily on the 20030619 version of the Jing RelaxNG parser written by thaiopensource.com (<a href='http://thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html'>http://thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html</a> ).  Thaiopensource has stopped development on Jing, so this will be an active replacement for bug fixes and new features.  The primary impetus for this is creating a version that will work on the 1.6 JDK.</strike>

**update** : James Clark has revived Jing and Trang - as the Google Code project [jing-trang](http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/).  I recommend that you use that instead.  I only created this fork because I needed to make Jing work with JDK 1.6, and James has done so with his revitalized project.
